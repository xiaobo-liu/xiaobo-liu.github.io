Welcome to the homepage of Xiaobo Liu, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Computational Methods in Systems and Control Theory (CSC) group](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/csc) at the [Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems (MPI-DCTS)](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/2316/en) in [Magdeburg, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdeburg), working with [Prof. Peter Benner](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/benner).

Prior to moving to Magdeburg, I was a research associate (Aug 2022-Dec 2023) in the [Numerical Linear Algebra Group (NLA Group)](https://nla-group.org/) at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), working with [Prof. Nicholas J. Higham](https://nhigham.com). I completed my PhD (Sep 2018-Jun 2022) in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/) at The University of Manchester under the supervision of [Prof. Nicholas J. Higham](https://nhigham.com) and [Prof. Fran√ßoise Tisseur](https://personal.maths.manchester.ac.uk/tisseur/).

My main research interests are in [Numerical Analysis](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/research/themes/numerical-analysis-and-scientific-computing/) and [Numerical Linear Algebra](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/research/expertise/numerical-linear-algebra/), including the design, development, and analysis of numerical algorithms (possibly) utilizing [mixed-precision arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-precision_arithmetic).
