Welcome to the my homepage, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Computational Methods in Systems and Control Theory group](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/csc) at the [Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems (MPI-DCTS)](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/2316/en) in [Magdeburg, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdeburg), working with [Prof. Peter Benner](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/benner).

Prior to moving to Magdeburg, I was a research associate (Aug 2022-Dec 2023) in the [Numerical Linear Algebra Group](https://nla-group.org/) at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), working with [Prof. Nicholas J. Higham](https://nhigham.com). I completed my PhD (Sep 2018-Jun 2022) in Manchester under the supervision of Prof. Nicholas J. Higham and [Prof. Françoise Tisseur](https://personal.maths.manchester.ac.uk/tisseur/).

I work on [Numerical Analysis](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/research/themes/numerical-analysis-and-scientific-computing/) and [Numerical Linear Algebra](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/research/expertise/numerical-linear-algebra/), including the design, development, and analysis of numerical algorithms (possibly) utilizing [mixed-precision arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-precision_arithmetic). 

Please feel free to contact me for potential collaboration or discussion on research problems within my area of expertise; here is a [.bib file](https://github.com/xiaobo-liu/xliu-bib/blob/main/xliu-bib.bib) that contains papers and preprints I have (co-)authored.
