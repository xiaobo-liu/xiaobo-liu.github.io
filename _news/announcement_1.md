I gave a talk in the minisymposium [Approximate Computing in Numerical Linear Algebra](https://numericalanalysisconference.org.uk/meetings/2023/minisymposia) organized by [Prof. Nicholas J. Higham](https://nhigham.com), [Dr. Bastien Vieubl√©](https://bvieuble.github.io/) and myself at the [29th Biennial Numerical Analysis Conference](https://numericalanalysisconference.org.uk/).
